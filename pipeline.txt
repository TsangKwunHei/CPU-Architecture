Manually simulate a 5-stage pipeline with hazards, stalls, and forwarding. 
To understand timing and instruction dependencies.

1st -- simplest loop
- simulate fetch, decode, execute
- calculator to do 1+1 in mac
- action (press 1) -> (press +) -> (press 1) 
    -> (press =) -> ( *calculates ) -> (*displays) = 6 instruction
