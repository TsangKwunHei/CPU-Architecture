Masterplan 


1. Be a chip Acrhitect that doesn't bottleneck the team
2. Be a better chip Acrhitect that deliver fasts
3. Use that foundation, be a even better chip Acrhitect 
while doing that, build cpp via hands on 


1 Be a chip Acrhitect that doesn't bottleneck ; Before 1st July
-- Build solid foundation for later
- Read through books to get a sense
- Know the excat terminology / definitions for easier learning later
- Hands on to learn

1.1 Terminology, Landscape of chip

 terminology flashcard v1 (50)  [v]
 chipwar book [v]

1.2 Foundation of CPU
- freynman method for concepts.
- memory for terminology.

1.3 Hands on pratice for foundation knowledge

a Simulate a CPU pipeline by hand
output : pipeline.txt [v]
b Cache simulator 
- simple logic direct map cahce, input access order, hit rate output
- LRU
output : cache_sim.cpp

c. gem5 
- run simple ARM program + 
- analysis of stages, cycles
output :  
d. ALU via cpp ;
- ADD, MINUS, AND, OR

output : alu.v + testcase


2 Be a better chip Acrhitect  
-- Can work given instruction, deliver on time
Hands on working
