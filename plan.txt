Masterplan 


1. Be a chip Acrhitect that doesn't bottleneck the team
2. Be a better chip Acrhitect that deliver fasts
3. Use that foundation, be a even better chip Acrhitect 
while doing that, build cpp via hands on 


1 Be a chip Acrhitect that doesn't bottleneck
-- Build solid foundation for later
1.1 Terminology, Landscape of chip
1.2 Foundation of CPU
1.3 Hands on pratice for foundation knowledge

2 Be a better chip Acrhitect  
-- Can work given instruction
